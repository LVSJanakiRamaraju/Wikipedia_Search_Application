# Wikipedia Search Application

This is a simple Wikipedia Search Application built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. The application fetches search results from Wikipedia's API and displays them in a user-friendly format.

## Features
- **Search Wikipedia**: Enter a keyword to fetch Wikipedia articles.
- **Dynamic Results**: Displays article title, link, and description dynamically.
- **Loading Indicator**: A spinner appears while fetching results.
- **Responsive Design**: Uses Bootstrap for styling and responsiveness.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the application
- **CSS (Bootstrap 4.5.2)**: Styling and responsiveness
- **JavaScript**: Handles API requests and DOM manipulations
- **Wikipedia API**: Fetches search results dynamically

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LVSJanakiRamaraju/Wikipedia_Search_Application.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Start searching for Wikipedia articles.

## How It Works
1. User types a keyword in the search input and presses `Enter`.
2. The application fetches search results from `https://apis.ccbp.in/wiki-search?search=keyword`.
3. Results are displayed dynamically with clickable links to Wikipedia articles.


## Future Improvements
- Add a **dark mode** option.
- Implement **pagination** for large search results.
- Enhance **error handling** for failed API requests.
